# NeuroBin

## Overview

NeuroBin is a distributed in-memory caching system, specifically optimized for handling high-dimensional data often used in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to provide rapid access to frequently used data, reducing latency in data retrieval and supporting scalable, efficient AI operations. 

**Note**: NeuroBin is currently under development and is considered a Work-In-Progress (WIP).

## To-Do

- [ ] Implement core in-memory caching logic.
- [ ] Integrate LSH for efficient similarity search.
- [ ] Develop distributed system architecture for scalability.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for interaction with the cache.
- [ ] Design and implement advanced caching and eviction policies.
- [ ] Set up a comprehensive testing framework.
- [ ] Write documentation and setup guides.
